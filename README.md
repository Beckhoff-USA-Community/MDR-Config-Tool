## About this Repository
A program for automating the generation,linking,and parameterizing of Beckhoff's EP7402
This project is in no way an Official product of Beckhoff Automation GMBH, and should be considered a sample of how Automation Interface can be used to reduce the manpower required to deploy configurations and controls to applications where complex I/O is to be used across multiple machines.

In order to run, export the contents of the Template_Files.zip file into a single folder. Select the destination folder of your export when choosig a drive list. The executable will look for the library, xcel/CSV file, and .xml file in that folder.
